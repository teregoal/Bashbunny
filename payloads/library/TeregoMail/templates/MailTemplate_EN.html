    <h1>Security awareness notice</h1>
    <p>I noticed that you left your computer unattended. </p>
    <p>It took me a simple USB device and a few seconds to start a script. Since I only want to raise your security awareness, I didn't do anything besides using your email account to send this email to yourself. You can check your Send Items to see that this email is indeed send bij your own account.</p>
    <p>To demonstrate what the risks are of leaving your computer unattended, I show you a list of wifi passwords that I found on your device.</p>

    [[OUTPUT]]

    <p>Don't worry. I only used these passwords to send you this email and as you can see - except for the first few - I replaced the characters with a star.</p>

    <p>You can prevent this types of attack by simply locking your computer. The easiest way to do this is by pressing Windows + L. Those who are not locking their computer by habit are far more likely to forget to lock it in public places. Better be safe that sorry.</p>

    <p>Regards,</p>
    <p>Your security officer</p>
